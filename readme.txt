== Description ==

[WP Time Capsule](http://wptimecapsule.com/ "Incremental Backup for WordPress") is the time-machine for your WordPress site. It uses Dropbox to backup your WordPress site. It does incremental backup - backing up only the changes that happened since previous backup rather the complete site every time. 

The Awesome features WP Time Capsule

Save more time - WP Time Capsule initially does a full backup. From there-on, it backups only the files that have changed rather than backing up the complete site every time.

Save the Files - WP Time Capsule uses Dropbox for storing backups. So your files are safe and secure.

Save the day - WP Time Capsule uses Dropbox revision history to restore files. So it just restores only the files that are needed.

Save more on server resource -  There is no compression/decompression of files and only the changes are backed up or restored. So, WPTC goes low on server resources when backup or restore is done

Save more on space - No need to handle multiple zip files of your backups. So you save more on your precious storage space
